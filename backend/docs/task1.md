# Task 1

The customer needs the backend services in order to provide a more personalised experience to their customers who use the Skyward website. This personalised experience will serve to differentiate Skyward from their competitors, which include other travel information websites and weather apps.

## Problems solved by backend services

The backend services solve the problem of the website only remembering saved locations for a particular browser, which meant that the user could not visit the website on other devices and see their saved locations. While having different saved locations on each device could have its own use case, for most users it was simply an inconvenience that likely deterred them from using the website on different devices.

## Benefits to users

- Personalisation - the user account allows users to access more personalised content, so it can be tailored to their needs and made more useful to them.
- Convenience - users will no longer have to repetitively search for their favourite locations again if they visit the website on a different device.
- Enhanced security - user's data is safer as it is now contained to their account, reducing the risk of unauthorised access with the use of the industry-standard JWT authentication.


## Impact on DFCorp's business

- User satisfaction will likely increase due to the enhanced personalisation and convenience features, which will improve the rate that users return to and keep using the website.
- Using industry standard security measures makes sure that DFCorp is up to date with their security compliance and keeps customer data safe, thus enhancing customer trust in DFCorp.
- DFCorp can differentiate itself from their competitors by offering a more personalised travel information service, allowing them to attract more users.
