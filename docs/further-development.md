# Further Development

There are many ways that DFCorp could extend the Skyward website to make it a one-stop platform for travel information for their customers.

## Additional travel features

The hotel carousel for each location could be adapted to allow customers to see more detailed information about hotels in their selected location, or even to book a hotel stay directly from the Skyward website. This could be achieved through integration of a hotel booking API, either in addition to the Priceline API that would currently be used to obtain hotel images, or a more comprehensive API in replacement.

Possible options are:

- Booking.com Demand API
- Hotels API by Api Dojo
- APItude Hotel APIs suite by Hotelbeds

The best choice would likely be the Booking.com Demand API. It offers access to Booking.com's extensive inventory of properties that should widely cover many different destinations, and can be integrated in four different application flows depending on how the stakeholder chooses to model the booking experience,ranging from simply browsing (similar to the current design) to providing the whole searching and booking experience directly from the application. Furthermore, Booking.com is a popular and trusted travel marketplace so partnering with them would provide assurance to DFCorp's customers that the booking they are making is genuine and their information is safe.
